# NDG Vulnerability Scanning
A quick lab I did while attending CWCT utilizing OpenVAS for vulnerability scanning.
<br />
This lab was performed in NDG, Cisco Network Academy.

<h2>Tools Used</h2>

- <b>OpenVAS:</b> Network vulnerability scanner
- <b>Kali Linux</b>: Operating System
- <b>OWASP Broken Web App</b>: Target

<h2>Initial Setup, Topology</h2>
This is the topology I was working with for this lab, including Kali Linux, a PfSense Firewall, and the OWASP BWA (Broken Web App).
<br />
I was tasked with performing an immediate scan, as well as a full scan on the web app.

<b>CVSS Base Score Calculator</b>
<br />
The CVSS Score Calculator can be modified as seen in the screenshot that is useful for CVE ratings.

<b>Default (Immediate) Scan</b>
<br />
After configuring the scan target, you can start an immediate scan pretty quickly. This is the default method for scanning targets.

<h2>Full Vulnerability Scanning</h2>
Below is a full scan that I performed, utilizing the "Full and very deep ultimate" configuration.

<h2>Lessons learned</h2>

- <b>Open source tools are insanely powerful.</b>
- <b>Reconnaisance and actively locating open vulnerabilities on endpoints.</b>
- <b>A lot of the time, there are a ton of options to customize scans.</b>
- <b>Save some money by using open source!</b>
